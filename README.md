# mosquitofish_CTmax-min
scripts for reproduction of results in mosquitofish CTmax/min project

# The following scripts should be run in R
run gene_pca.R for plotting PCA on gene expression
run DEG+topGO.R for differentially expressed genes (DEGs) analysis

run meth_pca.R for plotting PCA on methylation level
run DMC+topGO.R for differentially methylated sites (DMCs) analysis 

run AS_pca.R for plotting PCA on alternative splicing
run DSG+topGO.R for differentially spliced genes (DSGs) analysis
